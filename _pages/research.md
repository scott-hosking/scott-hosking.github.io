My group's research involves the application of AI and data science techniques on vast and various environmental datasets, including the output from climate models, and satellite and weather station data. 

We aim to identify and understand the key mechanisms that drive year-to-year climate variability over vulnerable regions, the changes in frequency and strength of extreme weather events, and to reduce uncertainties in future climate predictions.

In order to support business and policy decision making we aim to apply AI and data pipelines that are **interpretable** (_not 'black-box'_), **probabilistic**, and **reproducible**.
