Here I have listed some Python notebooks I use for research and teaching. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any comments - even just to say that you found these useful

### Getting started...
* [Using Baspy and Xarray to work with CMIP data](/notebooks/xarray_examples) 

### Research specific notebooks
* Automatic detection of low pressure systems from pressure fields or geopotential height fields. [Used here to detect the 'Amundsen Sea Low'](/notebooks/asl_detection)
