Here I have listed some `Python` notebooks I use for research and teaching. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any ~~complaints~~ comments - _even if just to say you found these useful_

## Getting started
* [Using Baspy and Xarray to work with CMIP data](/notebooks/xarray_examples) 

## Research
* Automatic detection of low pressure systems from pressure fields or geopotential height fields. [Used here to detect the 'Amundsen Sea Low'](/notebooks/asl_detection)
