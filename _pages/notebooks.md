Here I have listed some Python notebooks I use for research and teaching. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any ~~complaints~~ comments - _even if just to say you found these useful_

## Getting started
* Using [**BASpy** with **Xarray**](/notebooks/baspy_using_xarray) to read in climate model data (CMIP5)
* Getting weather station data from around the globe (both [monthly](/notebooks/ghcn_monthly) and [daily](/notebooks/ghcn_daily) averaged data) 

## Research
* Automatic detection of low pressure systems from pressure or geopotential height fields. Used here in this example to detect the [_Amundsen Sea Low_](/notebooks/asl_detection)

<sub>_I have other notebooks [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/scott-hosking/notebooks/tree/master/) which I may or may not migrate over time to this site_</sub>
