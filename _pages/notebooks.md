Here I have listed some `Python` notebooks I use for research and teaching. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any ~~complaints~~ comments - _even if just to say you found these useful_

## Getting started
* Analysiing climate model data (CMIP5) with the help of [**BASpy** and **Xarray**](/notebooks/xarray_examples) 
* Getting weather station data from around the globe (both [monthly](/notebooks/ghcn_monthly) and [daily](/notebooks/ghcn_daily) averaged data) 

## Research
* Automatic detection of low pressure systems from pressure or geopotential height fields. Used here in this example to detect the [_Amundsen Sea Low_](/notebooks/asl_detection)
