 the last 50 years West Antarctica has experienced one of the largest 
increases in regional temperature on Earth. Observed spatial trend 
patterns in surface temperature and sea ice extent indicate that these 
are likely linked to changes in the Amundsen Seas Low (ASL): a highly 
dynamic and mobile climatological low pressure system located in the 
Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. In this sector, variability in 
sea-level pressure is greater than anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere 
making it challenging to isolate local fluctuations in the ASL from 
larger-scale shifts in atmospheric pressure. BAS scientists have 
demonstrated that the position and strength of the ASL are crucial for 
understanding regional change (<a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00813.1">Hosking et al., 2013</a>).
 Furthermore, the state-of-the-art climate models which best simulate 
the ASL produce a better representation of the regional surface climate.
 As a major driver of West Antarctic climate variability, identifying 
the spread of ASL realisations across all the climate models is 
fundamental for reducing uncertainties in West Antarctica's past and 
improving predictions of future change (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL067143">Hosking et al., 2016</a>).  Additional information on these indices can be found on the <a href="https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/amundsen-sea-low-indices">Climate Data Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Two sets of indices which characterise the location and strength of the ASL are made available below.</p>

<p><b>ABSL or ASL?</b> In <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00813.1">Hosking et al. (2013)</a> we used the term Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas Low (ABSL).  However, following a dedicated <a href="http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/meetings/past/2013/asl-pcpi-2013">ASL workshop</a>, the term Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) is used for more recent publications.</p>

<h2>ASL Indices</h2>

<a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00813.1">Hosking et al. (2013)</a>
 found that the location of the ASL is an important driver of climate 
variability over West Antarctica.  Following this study, an updated set 
of indices were developed which includes a more robust way to identify 
the <b>ASL latitude and longitude</b> (see Version 2 below for more details).</p>  

<p>The <b>ASL Actual Central Pressure Index</b> is simply defined as the
 pressure at the ASL location.  Note that the ASL actual central 
pressure is strongly modulated by the Southern-Hemisphere Annual Mode 
(SAM) across all seasons, with time series correlations significant at <i>p</i>&lt;0.01.  For this reason we derive an alternative measure called the "Relative Central Pressure".</p>

<p>The <b>ASL Relative Central Pressure</b> is essentially a regional 
pressure anomaly.  It is calculated by subtracting the ASL actual 
central pressure from the area-averaged pressure over the ASL domain 
(domains are specified below).</p> 

<p>Note that the seasonal and annual indices are computed from their 
respective temporally averaged two-dimensional surface pressure fields. 
 They are not the average of the three (or twelve) points from the 
monthly indices.</p>

<h3>Dataset</h3>

<p>In version 2 and 3 the <b>ASL latitude and longitude</b> are identified 
using a minima finding algorithm within the ASL sector (here defined as 
170°—298° E, 80°—60° S, see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL067143">Hosking et al., 2016)</a>.</p>
