alt="Amundsen Sea Low (ASL)" width="200" align="right">Over
the last 50 years West Antarctica has experienced one of the largest 
increases in regional temperature on Earth. Observed spatial trend 
patterns in surface temperature and sea ice extent indicate that these 
are likely linked to changes in the Amundsen Seas Low (ASL): a highly 
dynamic and mobile climatological low pressure system located in the 
Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. In this sector, variability in 
sea-level pressure is greater than anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere 
making it challenging to isolate local fluctuations in the ASL from 
larger-scale shifts in atmospheric pressure. 
In <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00813.1">Hosking et 
al., 2013</a><sup>*</sup> we demonstrated that the position and strength of 
the ASL are crucial for understanding regional change. 
Furthermore, the <i>state-of-the-art</i> climate models which best simulate 
the ASL produce a better representation of the regional surface climate.

<sub>* In 
<a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00813.1">Hosking et 
	al. (2013)</a> we used the term Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas Low (ABSL).  
	However, following a dedicated 
	<a href="http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/wcrp/pcpi/meetings/764-amundsen-sea-low-workshop-for-pcpi-initiative">ASL 
		workshop</a>, the term Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) is now used for our more recent publications.</sub>

Following <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00813.1">Hosking et al. 
(2013)</a>, an updated set of indices were developed which includes a more robust way to identify 
the <b>ASL</b> 
(see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL067143">Hosking et al., 2016</a> for 
more details).</p>  

<p>The ASL latitude and longitude are identified 
using a minima finding algorithm within the ASL sector (170°—298° E, 80°—60° S). 
This dataset is derived using monthly ERA5 data and follows the same methodology as that used in 
<a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL067143">Hosking et al (2016)</a>
although is now re-written in python (see 
<a href="https://scott-hosking.github.io/notebooks/asl_detection/">notebook</a>).</p>

<p>The <b>ASL Actual Central Pressure Index</b> is simply defined as the
pressure at the ASL location.  Note that the ASL actual central 
pressure is strongly modulated by the Southern-Hemisphere Annual Mode 
(SAM) across all seasons, with time series correlations significant at <i>p</i>&lt;0.01.  
For this reason we derive an alternative measure called the "Relative Central Pressure".</p>

<p>The <b>ASL Relative Central Pressure</b> is essentially a regional 
pressure anomaly.  It is calculated by subtracting the ASL actual 
central pressure from the area-averaged pressure over the ASL domain 
(domain specified above).</p> 

<!-- <p>Note that the seasonal and annual indices are computed from their 
respective temporally averaged two-dimensional surface pressure fields. 
 They are not the average of the three (or twelve) points from the 
monthly indices.</p>  -->
