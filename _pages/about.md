I am an Environmental Data Scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.  My research involves using AI and machine learning techniques on vast and various datasets, including the output from global climate models and weather stations.  The primary aims of my work are to identify and understand the key mechanisms that drive year-to-year climate variability over vulnerable regions, the changes in frequency and strength of extreme weather events, and to reduce uncertainties in future climate predictions.
