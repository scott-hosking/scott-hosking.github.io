I am an _Environmental Data Scientist_ at the British Antarctic Survey ([BAS](http://www.bas.ac.uk)) and _Head of the_ [_BAS AI Lab_](http://www.bas.ac.uk/ai). I am also a _Senior Research Fellow_ at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and a _Co-Director_ of the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in the _Application of AI for the study of Environmental Risks_ ([_AI4ER_](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/)) at the University of Cambridge.

My research focuses on **artificial intelligence and data science** to identify and understand the physical mechanisms that drive **high-impact climate events** with the aim to reduce uncertainties in future predictions and help inform **environmental policy**.
