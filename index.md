I am an Environmental Data Scientist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS).  My research involves using AI and machine learning techniques on vast and various datasets, including the output from global climate models and weather stations.  The primary aims of my work are to identify and understand the key mechanisms that drive year-to-year climate variability over vulnerable regions, the changes in frequency and strength of extreme weather events, and to reduce uncertainties in future climate predictions.

My roles include:

* Head of the [Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://www.bas.ac.uk/ai) , British Antarctic Survey
* Co-Director of the [Centre for the Application of AI for the study of Environmental Risks](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge
