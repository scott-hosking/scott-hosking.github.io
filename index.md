I am an _Environmental Data Scientist_ at the British Antarctic Survey ([BAS](http://www.bas.ac.uk))
and [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).
My research focuses on artificial intelligence and data science 
to identify and understand the physical mechanisms that drive 
high-impact climate events with the aim to reduce uncertainties 
in future predictions and help inform environmental policy.
 
My primary roles are: 
* Leader of the [BAS AI Lab](http://www.bas.ac.uk/ai)
* Senior Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)
* Co-Director of the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in 
[AI for Environmental Risks (AI4ER)](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge.
