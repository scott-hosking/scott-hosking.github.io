I am an _Environmental Data Scientist_, Head of the [Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab](http://www.bas.ac.uk/ai) at the [British Antarctic Survey](http://www.bas.ac.uk) (BAS) environmental research institute, and a Senior Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) the UK national institute for data science and AI. 
I am also a Co-Director for the University of Cambridge Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in the [Application of AI to the study of Environmental Risks](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/) (AI4ER), a £6m UKRI funded programme to train over 50 top students to become future global leaders in environmental science. 

My research focuses on AI and data science methods to identify and understand the physical mechanisms that drive high-impact climate events with the aim to reduce uncertainties in future predictions and help inform environmental policy. 

## We are hiring!!
* 3 x Machine Learning Engineers/Researchers:
  * [UKRI Salary Band D (Early career researcher)](https://www.bas.ac.uk/jobs/vacancy/machine-learning-engineer-researcher-environmental-science-band-d/)
  * [UKRI Salary Band E (Experienced researcher)]((https://www.bas.ac.uk/jobs/vacancy/machine-learning-engineer-researcher-environmental-science-band-e/))
* 1 x [Research Software Engineer](https://www.bas.ac.uk/jobs/vacancy/it-research-software-engineer/)
* 1 x [HPC Support Engineer](https://www.bas.ac.uk/jobs/vacancy/hpc-support-engineer/)

## Studentships
As my [group](/group) has quickly grown this past year I am currently unable to take on any new Masters or PhD students. However, please feel free to reach out directly to my [science colleagues at BAS](https://www.bas.ac.uk/about/about-bas/our-organisation/our-science-teams/) if you are interested in doing a research project together with the [BAS AI Lab](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/ai).
