I am an _Environmental Data Scientist_, Head of the [Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab](http://www.bas.ac.uk/ai) at the [British Antarctic Survey](http://www.bas.ac.uk) (BAS) environmental research institute, and a Senior Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) the UK national institute for data science and AI. 
I am also a Co-Director for the University of Cambridge Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in the [Application of AI to the study of Environmental Risks](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/) (AI4ER), a £6m UKRI funded programme to train over 50 top students to become future global leaders in environmental science. 

My research focuses on AI and data science methods to identify and understand the physical mechanisms that drive high-impact climate events with the aim to reduce uncertainties in future predictions and help inform environmental policy. 
From 2021 I will also lead a new research programme to develop Digital Twins of the natural environment.
