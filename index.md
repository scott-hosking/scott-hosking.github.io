I am an Environmental Data Scientist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS).  My research involves using AI and machine learning techniques on vast and various datasets, including the output from global climate models and weather stations.  The primary aims of my work are to identify and understand the key mechanisms that drive year-to-year climate variability over vulnerable regions, the changes in frequency and strength of extreme weather events, and to reduce uncertainties in future climate predictions.

### My roles include:
* Head of the [Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://www.bas.ac.uk/ai) , British Antarctic Survey
* Co-Director of the [Centre for the Application of AI for the study of Environmental Risks](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge
* Board member of the [Cambridge Centre for Climate Science (CCfCS)](https://www.climatescience.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge
* Member of the [Centre for Science and Policy (CSaP) network](http://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/about-csap/people/our-network/), University of Cambridge
* Committee Member, [International Commission on Polar Meteorology](http://www.icpm-iamas.aq/)
* Associate Fellow, [Royal Meteorological Society](https://www.rmets.org/)

### Research interests
* Machine Learning in environmental sciences
* Extreme weather events and their impact on supply chains and infrastructure
* Weather and climate signals in high-resolution ice core records
* Atmospheric teleconnections between the tropics and the polar regions
