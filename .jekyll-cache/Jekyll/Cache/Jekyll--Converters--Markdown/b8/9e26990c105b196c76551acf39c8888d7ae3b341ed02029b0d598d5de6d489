I"`<p>My group’s research involves the application of AI and data science techniques on vast and various environmental datasets, including the output from climate models, and satellite and weather station data.</p>

<p>We aim to identify and understand the key mechanisms that drive year-to-year climate variability over vulnerable regions, the changes in frequency and strength of extreme weather events, and to reduce uncertainties in future climate predictions.</p>

<p>In order to support business and policy decision making we apply AI and data pipelines that are <strong>interpretable</strong> (<em>not black-box</em>), <strong>probabilistic</strong>, and fully <strong>reproducible</strong>.</p>
